### Overview

The purpose of this project was to data visualization to encourage investors to invest into a new bike-sharing company. For the challenge, a key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. Using Pandas to convert data and Tableau for visualizations, we are able to provide the required information to stakeholders.

### Results

![starting locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/144779110-b37c26b9-72a6-4f7c-9535-5761e5a82282.png)

The first image displays the starting locations of users while the second image displays the ending locations of users. As seen within both images, users are mostly starting and ending within concentrated areas on the bottom half of Manhattan. Due to the location of starting and ending areas, the bike sharing company should provide more bike stations within these areas.

The first image displays the usage of bikes divided by weekday and the hour of each day. The second image displays the same information except that it is also divided by gender. As seen in both images, bikes are more often used in morning and late afternoon hours on weekdays and mid afternoon hours on the weekend. Due to the findings, the company could possible raise rates during these times due to the higher demand for bikes.

![trip duration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/144779897-73749105-bc01-48f1-830c-576832b9811d.png)

![trip duration by gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/144779902-017654f0-3e4a-4593-98c2-ae331b5ded2c.png)

Both images display the usage time divided by the first three hours since after three hours, the data is nugatory. The second graph is divided by gender. As seen in the images, the usage of bikes by males is significantly higher then females.

![heatmap of usage by usertype](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/144780168-b2e30253-1c4d-449b-bc16-26f4727e0528.png)
 
The image above displays the usage by customer type divided by gender on certain days. As seen, there are more male subscribers than female subscribers thus reinforcing the line chart above displaying more male riders than female. 

### Summary

Overall, a starting a bike-sharing company within a city has a high probability of doing very well. Since most of the subscribers are males, the new company could look to advertise more torwards females. An additional visiualization I would like to perform would be to add landmarks popular amongst tourists which would help set up locations for more bike stations due to a possibly higher demand. Another visualization would be to create regions within Manhattan and find the mean income within each region. Since a majority of riders aren't tourists, a higher rate could be charged in locations with a higher mean income.
